 Wildfires in Sri Lanka pose a significant threat to  the country's ecosystems, economy and the communities. To  tackle the challenges associated with wildfires and work towards  mitigating their impact on the environment, wildlife, and human  populations, this research proposes a multidisciplinary  approach that leverages technological advancements. However,  the lack of an effective wildfire behavior prediction system,  limited access to reliable weather data, and communication gaps  among firefighting teams impede seamless collaboration,  information dissemination, and emergency response efforts. In  this regard, this project proposes a novel LoRa-based ad hoc  network integrated with blockchain technology to improve the  communication efficiency, safety, and detection of illegal fishing  activities in Sri Lanka's fisheries industry.
